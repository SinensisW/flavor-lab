# Flavor Lab — Written Proposal

## Summary
Flavor Lab is a personalized iteration engine for the home kitchen. It reduces decision fatigue and helps people make the most of what they already have by combining a structured recipe library with a playful “slot machine” discovery experience. The product captures cooking feedback (tweaks, taste, and photos) to build a loop that improves the recipe experience over time. For creators, it turns real-world adaptations into actionable insights rather than vanity metrics.

## Problem
Home cooks face three recurring pain points:

- **Decision fatigue**: “What should I eat tonight?” becomes a daily cognitive drain.
- **Inventory waste**: Ingredients are bought with good intentions but often expire unused.
- **Generic recipes**: Online recipes are optimized for the average person, not an individual household’s preferences.

Creators face a separate issue: they rarely see how recipes are adapted in real kitchens, so content improvement is based on guesswork.

## Solution
Flavor Lab solves the above through four loops:

1. **Inventory Awareness** (future): Track what’s in the fridge to surface recipes that reduce waste.
2. **Stochastic Discovery** (MVP): A “slot machine” mechanic reduces decision fatigue by offering a confident, fun suggestion.
3. **Culinary Feedback** (MVP): Structured feedback (tweaks, taste, photos) creates a personal flavor profile over time.
4. **Creator Insight** (later): Aggregated, anonymized data shows how recipes are actually cooked.

## MVP Scope (First 2 Hours)
The MVP targets Android and delivers a polished, testable prototype:

- **Recipe library** with hero images, ingredients, tools, steps, and creator links.
- **Save recipes** and browse a saved list.
- **Slot machine** discovery with animated roll + result modal.
- **“All done” feedback**: rating, tweaks, optional photo upload.
- **Timeline** of cooked recipes.
- **User profile** auto-created (anonymous), with placeholders for paid tiers.

## Target Users
- **Primary**: Busy home cooks (ages 20–40) who want fast, low-friction meal decisions.
- **Secondary**: Food creators who want structured feedback and iteration data.

## Differentiation
- Fun, low-effort decision making instead of browsing endless lists.
- Feedback loop that personalizes recipes over time.
- Creator-focused analytics (later) that go beyond likes and saves.

## Business Model (Planned)
- **Freemium**: core recipe discovery is free.
- **Paid tiers**: advanced personalization, inventory automation, and creator insights.
- **Creator partnerships**: revenue share for featured recipes.

## Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Recipe library, slot machine, feedback loop, timeline.
- **Phase 2**: Manual inventory tracking, smarter recommendations.
- **Phase 3**: Creator dashboard + paid tiers.
- **Phase 4**: Real-time inventory automation via receipts + vision.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Cold start**: Use curated recipes at launch and strong starter content.
- **Engagement decay**: Add streaks, badges, and seasonal challenges.
- **Data quality**: Make feedback optional but fast (one-tap rating + photo).

## Success Metrics
- Day-7 retention > 20%
- Average sessions per week > 3
- % of recipes completed with feedback > 25%
- Recipe saves per user > 5 in first week

## Ask
We are seeking validation through rapid user testing. The MVP is ready for distribution once Firebase configuration and Android build steps are completed. Next step is to publish a private beta and gather feedback from 10–30 early users.
